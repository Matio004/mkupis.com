# Observations
**Observations** is an aplication developed as an assignment for Programing in Python course. It allows user to store, add and delete data which would later be used to predict category of given observation.
Prediction is made using scikit-learn KNeighborsClassifier (before running algorithm data is scaled using StandardScaler).

## Features
